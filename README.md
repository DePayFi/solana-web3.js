## Test environment (node based)

In case you need to load this pre-built into a node test environment (like jest), make sure you supply globals for `crypto` and `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`:

```
global.crypto = require('@peculiar/webcrypto').Crypto
global.fetch = require('cross-fetch')
global.XMLHttpRequest = require('xhr2')
global.location = {}
```

Make sure you install `@peculiar/webcrypto`, `cross-fetch` and `xhr2` as dev dependencies:

```
yarn add @peculiar/webcrypto cross-fetch xhr2 --dev
```

## Node environment

In case you need to load this pre-built into a node production environment, make sure you supply globals for `crypto` and `fetch` and `XMLHttpRequest`:

```
global.crypto = new (require('@peculiar/webcrypto').Crypto)()
global.fetch = require('cross-fetch')
global.XMLHttpRequest = require('xhr2')
global.location = {}
```

Make sure you install `@peculiar/webcrypto`, `cross-fetch` and `xhr2` as dependencies:

```
yarn add @peculiar/webcrypto cross-fetch xhr2
```

## Development

```
yarn build
```

```
npm publish --access public
```
